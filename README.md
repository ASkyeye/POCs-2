# PoC Repository for CVEs and Vulnerabilities

Welcome to the PoC (Proof of Concept) repository for demonstrating CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and other security vulnerabilities. This repository contains code snippets, scripts, and PoCs related to security vulnerabilities discovered in various software, libraries, and frameworks.

## About

This repository serves as a collection of PoCs developed by [Author Name] (Robin) to showcase security vulnerabilities and their exploitation techniques. Each PoC is categorized based on the CVE identifier or the type of vulnerability it demonstrates.

## Contents

- **CVE PoCs**: Demonstrations for CVEs with detailed explanations and exploitation techniques.
- **Vulnerability PoCs**: PoCs for security vulnerabilities not assigned with CVEs, covering a wide range of topics such as SQL injection, XSS, RCE, etc.
- **Exploit Scripts**: Python scripts, shell scripts, and other tools developed to exploit specific vulnerabilities.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have developed a PoC for a CVE or a security vulnerability, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your contribution follows the guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
